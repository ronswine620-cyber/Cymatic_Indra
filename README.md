# 🕸️ Cymatic Indra
**Self-Organizing Topological Intelligence & Emergent Coherence**

> *"The Net is infinite, and the reflections are eternal."*

**Cymatic Indra** is a biomimetic simulation engine designed to explore **morphogenesis**, **synchronization**, and **ontological resilience**. Inspired by the Buddhist metaphor of *Indra's Net* and the physics of cymatics, the system treats data not as discrete tokens, but as vibratory frequencies that "crystallize" into topological invariants on a reactive manifold.

## 🌌 The Metaphor

In the celestial net of the great god Indra, a jewel is set at every intersection. Each jewel reflects all others, and in that reflection, it contains the reflections of the entire universe.

In this system:
* **The Jewels (`IndraOscillator`):** Autonomous agents sensing and vibrating in $N$-dimensional space.
* **The Plate (`CymaticManifold`):** The elastic substrate where patterns are etched and memories are stored.
* **The Spider (`IndraEngine`):** The coordinator that filters noise, ensures synchronization, and "gardens" the network topology.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. The Jewels (`cymatic_indra.oscillator`)
Autonomous phase-oscillators that generate complex trajectories. Unlike LLM agents that output text, these agents output **Cymatic Trajectories**. They do not just "speak"; they *resonate* with the current state of the environment (the Manifold).

### 2. The Plate (`cymatic_indra.manifold`)
A reactive topological memory. It acts as a **"Read-Write" substrate** that:
* **Imprints:** Etches persistent structures when coherence is achieved ($Z > 0.8$).
* **Elasticity:** Naturally decays over time, requiring constant reinforcement (active maintenance).
* **Topology:** Uses **Betti-0 Analysis** (Union-Find) to detect fractures in the system’s unity.

### 3. The Spider (`cymatic_indra.core`)
The "Executive" layer of the system. It handles the heavy-lifting logic:
* **Spectral Sieve:** Uses FFT to extract frequency invariants from raw signals (The "CLT" Layer).
* **Phase-Locking:** Uses an adaptive Kuramoto-style coupling to drive the system toward a "Crystallized" state.
* **Broken Functor Filtering:** A unique adversarial defense. If an input signal attempts to "break" the functional continuity of the net (phase delta > `phase_wrap_thresh`), the engine treats the input as a "Broken Functor," shielding the rest of the Jewels from contamination.
